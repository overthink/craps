# Craps Simulator

Know how much money your strategy is going to lose in the long run.

## Current Status

WIP

## Development

* Be on Linux or Mac
* Have `devbox` and `direnv` installed
* Use `just --list` to see how to do common things
* pnpm is present only to install codex-cli in case that's your thing

## Prior Art

Sean Kent's [https://github.com/skent259/crapssim](crapssim) is a very similar
projec and much further along. Sean has some good writings on craps (linked
from above) too.
